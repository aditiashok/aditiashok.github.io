	<h1> About Me </h1>

	<p> I am currently a junior at Tufts University, originally from San Jose, California. I am interested in
	    computer science, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, and education, and am hoping to explore the
	    interface between the human mind, education, and computer technology. I am pursuing a major in Computer
	    Science with a minor in Cognitive and Brain Sciences. Currently, I am exploring career options in 
	    software development, education technology, artificial intelligence, and human computer interaction. 
	    In my free time, I enjoy writing, photography, exercising, and cooking. </p>

	<p> If you are interested in working with me, please shoot me an email at <em style = "text-decoration:underline;
